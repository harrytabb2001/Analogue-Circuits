# Analogue Circuits
## Summary 
Third lab experiment from my first year undergraduate in Physics at The University of Manchester. All data analysis was done in Excel so no .py files are included.
Note that no report was written for this experiment.

The aim of this experiment was to confirm analogue circuit theory by building a range of circuits such as LCR combinations and integrating and differentiating circuits.

# Technical Highlights
* Data Analysis in Excel
* Linear Regression in Excel
* Chi-Square Analysis

# Files
* Analogue Circuits Lab Script.pdf contains a brief outline of the experiment given to me before I started.
* Analogue Circuits Notebook.pdf contains my handwritten notes from during the experiment including a schematic diagram, key figures, snippets of the recorded data, calculations, data analysis and conclusions.
